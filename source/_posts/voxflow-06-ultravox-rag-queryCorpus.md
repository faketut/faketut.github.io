*The `queryCorpus` tool, and why letting your platform handle RAG is sometimes the right call.*

## What RAG means on a phone call

Retrieval-Augmented Generation lets an LLM cite facts from your private knowledge base — clinic hours, insurance policies, return policy, FAQ — without those facts being baked into the model.

On a phone call this is essential: callers ask questions that the model has no way to know ("What's your address?", "Do you take Aetna?", "What time do you open Sunday?"). Without RAG you either hallucinate or refuse.

## Two ways to do it

**Option A: Build it yourself.**
1. Chunk documents → embed → store in vector DB (Pinecone, Weaviate, pgvector)
2. On each user turn: embed query → similarity search → top-K chunks
3. Inject chunks into the conversation context
4. Manage the embedding pipeline, re-indexing, evaluation

**Option B: Let the voice platform do it.**
1. Upload documents to the platform UI
2. Get a `corpus_id`
3. Register a `queryCorpus` tool on every call
4. Done

VoxFlow goes with option B because Ultravox already runs the retrieval inside its inference path, where it can be sub-100ms.

## The tool registration

```python
{
    "toolName": "queryCorpus",
    "parameterOverrides": {
        "corpus_id": ULTRAVOX_CORPUS_ID,
        "max_results": 5,
    },
}
```

That's the entire integration. No vector DB to operate. No re-embedding when documents change. No "retrieval evaluation" notebook. The corpus lives in Ultravox's storage, gets re-indexed when you upload new docs, and the model decides when to query it.

## When the AI calls the tool

You don't write a prompt that says "always retrieve before answering." You write a prompt that *gives the model permission*:

```
## Handling Questions
Use the function `queryCorpus` to respond to customer queries
and questions about clinic services, hours, or pricing.
```

The model decides per turn whether the question needs retrieval. Asking "How are you?" → no retrieval. Asking "What time do you close on Sundays?" → `queryCorpus(question="Sunday closing hours")`.

This judgment is genuinely good in modern models. You waste fewer tokens than always-retrieve, and the model knows when it doesn't need to look something up.

## What the client-side handler does

In VoxFlow it does almost nothing:

```python
async def handle_queryCorpus(uv_ws, invocation_id, params: QueryCorpusParams) -> None:
    # Ultravox performs the actual corpus query server-side;
    # this client-side hook just logs.
    logger.info("[Q&A] question=%s", params.question)
```

The retrieval happens inside Ultravox. The "tool call" is just an event the platform emits so the client (you) can log, audit, or react.

## Trade-offs of platform-managed RAG

**Wins:**
- Zero infrastructure
- Sub-100ms retrieval inside the model's loop
- No re-embedding maintenance
- Same vendor handles the eval feedback loop

**Losses:**
- Vendor lock-in for your knowledge base
- Limited control over chunking strategy
- Can't mix data sources (e.g., live DB query + vector results)
- Pricing tied to platform tier

**When to switch to self-built RAG:**
- Your knowledge base is dynamic (real-time inventory, account-specific data)
- You need to combine RAG with live API calls in one retrieval step
- Compliance requires data not leaving your VPC
- Your retrieval scoring needs custom rerankers

## A realistic corpus for VoxFlow

For a dental clinic, the corpus might contain:
- Services and procedures with pricing
- Accepted insurance providers
- Office hours per location
- Booking policies (cancellation windows, etc.)
- Emergency protocols
- Staff bios

~20 short documents. Total embedding cost on Ultravox: pennies. Updates: drag-and-drop in their UI.

## What "max_results: 5" actually controls

It's the number of chunks the retriever returns. Five is a reasonable default:
- Too few (1-2): model misses related context
- Too many (10+): noise dilutes the answer, latency creeps up

If callers ask broad questions ("tell me about your practice"), bump it. If they ask specific ones ("Sunday hours"), keep it low.

## Takeaway

You don't always need to build RAG from scratch. Voice platforms with built-in retrieval erase a huge chunk of operational complexity. Reach for self-built RAG only when the platform constraints actually bite.
